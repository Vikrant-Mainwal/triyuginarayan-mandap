        We saw many couples visiting this holy place with devotion, but
        struggling with the wedding process — where to stay, how to arrange
        rituals, how to manage it all. That’s when the idea of Triyuginarayan
        Mandap came to us. We wanted to help couples have a peaceful, spiritual
        wedding here, without stress or confusion.
